Mountain Hiking App

This is a one-page application that was created using ReactJS

Tech Used:
1) React Cards
2) React Router
3) ReactJS

There are a total of 4 pages
**First page (Home Page):**
This is the about page. It should show what the company is about and also introduce the team members

**Second page (Get Inspired):**
This is the page where users can go to search about mountains. At the top of the page, there should be a row of cards that introduces the peaks of each continent. Also on the page, there is an API call to wikipedia. 
Potential improvements that could be done:
1) Have a database of mountains names. When users search for a something, the search would first try to match the search with the mountain names and if it is a match, send the request to wikipedia.

**Third page (Products):**
The third page is a list of tour packages that the company offers to potential clients
Users should be able to click a button to add the specific item to the cart in the next page.
Items should be only able to be added once. (Users should go to the carts page to input number of participants)

**Fourth page (Cart):**
This is the cart page. 
There should be a subtotals section to let users know how much to pay.
Users should be able to input the number of participants that is going for the package. 
The cart page will then update the subtotals to reflect the amount.
